Overview for the busy developer
-------------------------------

* HTTPS, JSON, UTF-8, HAL, TUK (The URL is King)
* HAL adds metadata to each resource to find:
  * related resources
  * potential actions
  * documentation
* optional ETAGs
* pre-defined query parameters like ``offset``, ``limit``, ``_expand``, ``_body`` and ``_links``
* pagination always looks the same
* required field types, for example ISO 8601 (dates), ISO 4217 (money)
* definition of error responses

History
-------

At Marktplaats developers were not so happy with previous API developments. The SOAP API was intimately tied to
the database schema and didn't actually follow any SOAP standard. An attempt to re-create it in Scala failed on the
fact that it was too much work.

Then there was an eCG wide initiative called 'Common API'. At Marktplaats it was deemed too restrictive. It required
the use of Java, and it was not possible/easy to extend it (for example with JSON responses).

With this background developers sat together end of 2013 to come up with a new set of guidelines. The focus would be
on freedom of changing the API over time and freedom of implementation choice. It should be applicable to any use case
while still being friendly for mobile applications.

After the API focus team was done, the first implementation would be the new Marktplaats API. Work on this started in
2014Q2. At about the same time, the CAS team started to change their API to match.

To surprise of the team, the guidelines were quickly promoted to an eCG standard with backing from our CTO Brent McLean.

Advantages
----------

* Teams are free to chose their technology for the implementation.
* The guidelines enforce an API that can grow and stay relevant.
* The guidelines lower the amount of surprises which can speed up implementations.

The future
----------

The guidelines currently are currently missing a few important ingredients which can be added in the future:

* Bulk/batch API, making it possible to do multiple API requests in one HTTP request.
* Volume limitations.
* Streaming API.
* A change-the-guidelines process.
